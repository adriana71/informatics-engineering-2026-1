# Problem

Write a method that rolls a pair of dice until the sum of the numbers rolled is a specific number. We also want to know the number of times the dice are rolled to get the desired sum.
The smallest number on each die is 1 and the largest number is 6. So the smallest sum of
the numbers rolled is 2 and the largest sum of the numbers rolled is 12

You can use a random number generator, to randomly generate a number between 1 and 6 and stores that number into a variable _die1_, which becomes the number rolled by the die 1. 
Similarly, the following statement randomly generates a number between 1 and 6 and stores that number into _die2_, which becomes the number rolled by die 2.

The sum of the numbers rolled by two dice is _die1_ + _die2_.

Next, we determine whether _die1_ + _die2_ is equal to the desired sum of the numbers rolled by the dice. If sum does not equal the desired sum, then we roll the dice again.

Write the method _rollDice_ that takes as a parameter thhe desired sum of the numbers to be rolled and returns the number of ties the dice are rolled to roll the desire sum
